# Contributing Guidelines

- Start with the files in the `template` folder.
- Please do not modify the dimensions of the canvas or the styling of the page.
- Feel free to add additional javascript files if you feel like main.js is too cluttered.
- Give your sketch a snappy title and subtitle!
- Save your sketch in a new folder `your_sketch_title`
- That's it!
